# scTools
a scrappy set of scripts to manipulate single cell bams and fastqs



Everything is a work in progress, I make no assurances these scripts work correctly.

*methods*
-Interoperability between barcoded fastqs and bams
  -conversion of bams to fastq while maintaining cell barcodes
-Filtering fastqs and bams based on cell barcodes
-Merging bams and correcting for duplicate barcodes (incoming)
-various useful bash one-liners
